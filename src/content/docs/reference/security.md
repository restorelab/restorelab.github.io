RestoreLab is a privileged piece of infrastructure. It holds credentials that
can restore, boot and destroy virtual machines, and it reads your backup
catalogue. This document states what it protects, how, and what it does not
protect against.

## Threat model

| Asset | Threat | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Proxmox / PBS API tokens | Read from disk, from a backup of the config, or from a leaked log | Sealed with AES-256-GCM under a master key stored separately; never logged, never included in error messages |
| Production workloads | Deleted, modified or overwritten by a bug in RestoreLab | Delete requires ownership metadata; restores only ever create new workloads in a reserved ID range; no `force` flag is ever sent to Proxmox |
| Production network | A restored clone takes traffic, sends mail, or claims an IP | Isolated bridge by default, network configuration rewritten before first boot, isolation verified on the node, runs refused otherwise |
| Cluster capacity | Drills saturate the cluster and impact production | Concurrency limits, per-run CPU/RAM caps, capacity check before restore |
| Backups | Pruned, deleted or overwritten | The PBS token is read-only (`DatastoreAudit`); RestoreLab never writes to a backup datastore, and never asks for `Datastore.Allocate`, the privilege that would let it delete one |

## Secret handling

- The only secrets RestoreLab stores are provider API tokens.
- They are sealed with **AES-256-GCM**, a random 12-byte nonce per value, and
  written as `rlsec:v1:<base64>`. The version prefix exists so the scheme can be
  rotated later.
- The **master key is never stored in the configuration file**. It is resolved,
  in order, from:
  1. `RESTORELAB_MASTER_KEY` (base64 or hex, 32 bytes) — the right choice for
     containers, systemd units and CI;
  2. an explicit `--master-key-file`;
  3. `~/.restorelab/master.key`, created with `0600` by `restorelab init`.
- Saving a configuration containing an unsealed secret is **refused** by the
  config layer. That guard is what keeps a plaintext token off disk even if a
  future code path forgets to seal.
- Secrets are never printed: the provider type redacts itself in `String()`, and
  API errors truncate and sanitise response bodies.

**Losing the master key means losing every stored token.** They must be
re-entered — RestoreLab cannot and will not recover them. Back the key up
somewhere your configuration backup is not.

## The daemon keeps the master key in memory

Every other RestoreLab command loads the master key, unseals what it needs,
and exits within seconds. `restorelab serve` cannot do that: it has to answer
requests and query the cluster with no human present to unlock anything, so
it unseals provider secrets at startup and **keeps the master key in memory
for as long as the process runs**.

Stated plainly, because softening it would just mean someone finds out the
hard way: **a memory dump of the `serve` process hands an attacker your
unsealed Proxmox secrets.** There is no honest way around this. A separate
decryption agent that `serve` calls into for every request would face the
identical problem — the secret still has to exist, unsealed, somewhere
reachable by the process doing the querying — and it would add a second
process to secure instead of removing the exposure.

What actually reduces the risk is operational, not cryptographic:

- Run `serve` as a **dedicated, unprivileged user with no interactive
  shell**. It has no business being the same account you SSH in as.
- **Do not colocate it** with anything else. A daemon sharing a host with
  unrelated services multiplies what a single compromise of that host
  reaches.
- Keep the listener on **loopback**, behind a reverse proxy that terminates
  TLS and — where it matters — client authentication (see
  [Starting the server](/reference/http-api/#starting-the-server)). A process that never
  binds a public interface is a process an external attacker cannot reach
  directly at all.
- Give that account the strict minimum on `~/.restorelab`: read access to
  `config.yaml` and `master.key`, write access to `history.db`. Nothing else.

None of this closes the exposure. It shrinks who can reach the process well
enough to read its memory in the first place, which is the only lever
available once a design commits to querying a cluster without a human
present at every request.

### And that process now destroys things

`serve` runs a worker by default, and that worker executes drills: it
allocates temporary VMIDs, restores backups onto them, boots them, and deletes
them again. Everything the previous section says about the account running
`serve` applies **more** strongly now, not less. It is no longer a daemon that
reads your cluster; it is a daemon that writes to it, unattended, whenever a
row appears in a queue.

Two consequences worth stating rather than leaving to be discovered:

- The dedicated account's exposure is now the union of the master key in its
  memory and the destructive work it does with it. Compromising the process
  does not merely leak the provider token — it hands over a running loop that
  already knows how to restore and delete workloads on your cluster.
- Splitting the process is a real mitigation, not just a deployment option.
  `restorelab serve --no-worker --worker-elsewhere` in a DMZ and
  `restorelab serve --no-listen` on the administration network gives you a
  reachable half that cannot touch the cluster at all and a cluster-touching
  half that nothing external can reach. The two halves share only the
  database. Whether that is worth a second process is your call; the point is
  that it is available.

The guardrails in [Destructive-operation guardrails](#destructive-operation-guardrails)
below are the same for a drill triggered over HTTP as for one triggered from a
terminal — the API queues a row and a worker runs the same
`recovery.Engine`, with the reserved ID range, the ownership metadata and the
always-runs cleanup all intact. Nothing about the HTTP path relaxes them.

## API tokens

`restorelab serve` accepts its own credential, separate from any provider
secret: a bearer token created with `restorelab token create <name>`. A few
choices about it are worth stating explicitly:

- **Stored hashed, never in the clear.** Only the SHA-256 of a token is
  written to the database; `token create` prints the secret exactly once,
  and there is nothing left afterward that could be used to print it again.
- **SHA-256, deliberately, not argon2id.** argon2id exists to slow down
  cracking a *guessable* secret — a password a human chose. A RestoreLab
  token is 32 bytes straight out of `crypto/rand`: there is nothing to
  guess, and brute-forcing it costs 2²⁵⁶ operations regardless of how fast
  the hash is. A slow hash would buy no additional security here, would burn
  CPU on every authenticated request, and would hand an unauthenticated
  caller a trivial denial-of-service lever — one argon2 computation per
  guess thrown at the server. GitHub and Stripe hash their own tokens the
  same way, for the same reason. See the comment on `HashToken` in
  `internal/api/auth.go` for the full reasoning.
- **Compared in constant time.** The lookup is by hash, but the match is
  still verified with `crypto/subtle.ConstantTimeCompare`, so no comparison
  in the authentication path leaks how many leading bytes matched.
- **Prefixed `rl_`.** A token that leaks into a log, a ticket or a public
  repository is recognisable as a RestoreLab credential on sight, which is
  what lets it be revoked instead of puzzled over.

### Scopes

A token holds `read`, and may additionally hold `operate`, `manage`, or both.
`read` covers every `GET` route, including the live event stream and the plan
catalogue. `operate` adds the three writes that touch the cluster: triggering
a drill, cancelling one, and destroying a temporary workload that was left
behind. `manage` adds the three that touch the catalogue: creating, changing
and deleting stored plans.

**`operate` and `manage` do not imply each other, in either direction.** That
separation is the reason `manage` is its own scope rather than more room
inside `operate`. Triggering a drill and deciding what a drill *is* are
different powers over different things: one restores backups and destroys
machines, the other rewrites the definition of what will be restored — and,
once the scheduler exists, of what will be restored *unattended*. A token
given to a dashboard so it can launch and cancel should not be able to
redefine what it launches; a token given to a CI job so it can apply a
directory of plans from git should not be able to restore anything by itself.
A token that genuinely needs both says so, explicitly, at creation.

**`read` is the default, and `--operate` has to be asked for.** A read token
can look at a dashboard. An operate token can make RestoreLab restore backups,
boot machines and delete them, as often as its holder chooses to ask. Those
are not the same credential and they should not be issued as if they were, so
`token create` prints in full what an operate token can do at the one moment
the secret is still on screen, and `token list` puts `SCOPES` in the table
rather than behind a flag — which token can destroy machines is the first
thing anyone auditing that list needs to see.

**Tokens issued before scopes existed read back as `read`.** The migration
that added the column defaults it to `read` for every existing row. That is
deliberate and worth being explicit about as a rule for future migrations
too: *a schema change must never grant an existing credential a power it did
not have when it was issued.* The reverse — defaulting to `operate` so that
nothing appears to break during an upgrade — would silently promote every
dashboard token in the fleet. If one of those tokens is meant to trigger
drills, issue a new one with `--operate` and revoke the old.

Adding `manage` cost no migration at all, and could not have widened anything
even if it had: the `scopes` column already existed, nothing writes `manage`
into a row that did not ask for it, and no scope implies it. An existing
`operate` token is exactly as powerful the day after the upgrade as the day
before.

**A refused write is 403, never 401.** Authentication runs first: a request
with no token, or an unknown one, gets `401` and the same single message every
failed authentication gets. A request whose token is valid but lacks the scope
the route needs gets `403`. Collapsing the two would be an operational trap, not a cosmetic
one — `401` tells the caller its credential is broken, and the honest response
to that is to regenerate the token, revoke the old one, and redeploy, none of
which fixes anything here. `403` says the token is exactly who it claims to
be and simply was not granted this, which points at the one action that does
help.

Scopes are not RBAC and are not sold as such. **They bound verbs, not
reach.** There is no per-workload restriction and no per-provider
restriction: an operate token can drill anything RestoreLab can see, and a
manage token can rewrite any plan in the catalogue. Finer-grained access
control is a roadmap item (`v0.4`, with RBAC and OIDC), and until it exists a
token should be scoped by *who holds it*, not by what it can reach.

## The dashboard session

A browser cannot hold a bearer token safely, and `EventSource` cannot send an
`Authorization` header at all. So the dashboard trades a token for a session
cookie once, at `POST /api/v1/session`, and carries that cookie afterwards.
The cookie is a second way to present the same credential — never a second,
larger credential.

**A session names a token and carries no scope of its own.** The `api_sessions`
row holds a hash, a `token_id` and an expiry, and nothing else. Every request
that arrives on a cookie reads the scopes from the token row it joins to, in
the same query that resolves the session. There is no copy to keep in sync and
nothing to propagate, which has two consequences worth stating separately:

- **Revocation is immediate.** `restorelab token revoke <name>` writes
  `revoked_at`; the join requires `revoked_at IS NULL`, so the next request on
  any session opened with that token is a `401`. Not in twelve hours — on the
  next request. The check is in the SQL rather than in Go on purpose: a
  caller left to verify it itself would eventually forget, and a revoked
  credential would keep working for the rest of the day.
- **A cookie can never widen anything.** A session on a `read` token cannot
  trigger a drill, and there is no code path by which it could: the scope check
  reads the token, and the token is the same row `token list` prints.

**The expiry is absolute: twelve hours, never extended.** A sliding expiry
would be more comfortable — nobody would be logged out mid-drill — but an open
tab polling a listing would then hold a credential that can destroy machines
indefinitely. Twelve hours covers a working day. Opening a session also
deletes every expired session in the same transaction, so the table cleans
itself at exactly the rate it fills, with no background job to own.

The secret is 32 bytes from `crypto/rand`, prefixed `rls_`, and only its
SHA-256 is stored — the same treatment, for the same reasons, as a token.

### The cookie's attributes

`__Host-restorelab_session`, `Path=/`, no `Domain`, `HttpOnly`, `Secure`,
`SameSite=Strict`. Each of those is load-bearing:

- **`__Host-` prefix.** A browser refuses to store a cookie with this prefix
  unless it is `Secure`, is scoped to `Path=/`, and names no `Domain`. That
  moves three invariants into the client, where no bug on this side can weaken
  them. It also blocks cookie fixation from a sibling: a compromised
  `other.example.com` cannot set a `__Host-` cookie that `app.example.com`
  would read.
- **`HttpOnly`.** `document.cookie` cannot see it, so an injected script cannot
  copy the session out and replay it from elsewhere. It does not stop that
  script from *using* the session in place — which is what the CSP below is
  for.
- **`Secure`.** The cookie never travels in clear, so a passive observer on the
  path sees nothing to replay.
- **`SameSite=Strict`.** The browser does not attach the cookie to a request
  another site initiated. That closes ordinary CSRF at the client, before the
  request is even sent.

### The `Origin` guard, and what `SameSite` does not cover

`SameSite=Strict` stops another *site*. It does not stop a sibling subdomain:
`app.example.com` and `evil.example.com` are the same site to a cookie and two
different origins to everything else. A compromised subdomain — a forgotten
staging host, a wiki, anything sharing the registrable domain — could
otherwise make authenticated writes with a user's session.

So every unsafe method authenticated **by a cookie** must carry an `Origin`
matching the request's own `Host`, or it is a `403`. A missing `Origin` is
refused too: browsers send it on every write, so its absence on a cookie
request is not the ordinary case.

The reference is the request's `Host` rather than a configured origin, because
the dashboard is served by this same binary: the legitimate origin is by
construction the one just reached, and a value to configure is a value to get
wrong. The deployment corollary is in `docs/deployment.md` and is not optional
— a reverse proxy that does not forward the original `Host` turns every
dashboard write into a `403`.

The guard sits on the cookie path only. A bearer request never reaches it, so
a CLI is never refused for a header browsers send and API clients do not.

### Plain HTTP is refused off loopback

Because the cookie is always `Secure`, a browser on `http://192.168.1.5:8080`
stores nothing at all: the login appears to succeed, every request afterwards
is anonymous, and nothing in any response explains it. `POST /session` refuses
with a `400` naming TLS instead. Loopback is exempt, because browsers treat
`localhost` as a trustworthy origin; `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` is believed,
because this guard exists against a misconfiguration rather than an attacker —
anyone able to forge that header is already speaking to the process directly.

### The bundle's Content-Security-Policy

Every dashboard response carries
`default-src 'self'; base-uri 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'; object-src 'none'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'`,
plus `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`.

This is the header that matters most on this surface. `HttpOnly` stops a
script from *reading* the session; it does not stop one from using it. The
defence against an injected script is not letting one run, and everything the
page needs is same-origin because the bundle is served by this binary.
`'unsafe-inline'` is conceded on styles alone — a popover library positions
with a `style` attribute — and opens no script execution.

That policy is also a constraint on the interface's own source, and it is the
kind that bites late: **the Vite dev server does not send it.** Anything the
policy forbids works perfectly on `:5173` and fails silently in the binary,
usually as a missing font or a blank panel with nothing in the response to
explain it. So, for anyone changing `web/`:

- **No external font.** `font-src` falls back to `'self'`, so Google Fonts and
  every other hosted face is blocked. The system stack in `index.css` is not a
  style preference; it is the only option.
- **No external image, and no `data:` URI.** `img-src` falls back to `'self'`
  too. Icons are inline SVG components, which is why they work.
- **No CDN script, and no inline `<script>`.** Everything ships in the bundle.
- **No third-party endpoint.** `connect-src` is `'self'`: `fetch` and
  `EventSource` reach this binary and nothing else. A dashboard for a disaster
  recovery tool has no business talking to anyone but its own server, so this
  is a property worth keeping rather than a limitation to work around.

If a change genuinely needs one of these, the policy is in `uiCSP`
(`internal/api/static.go`) and widening it is a security decision, not a build
fix.

### No rate limit on the login, deliberately

`POST /api/v1/session` is not rate-limited, and that is a decision rather than
an omission. It is the same reasoning already written on `HashToken`: the
credential being presented is 32 bytes from `crypto/rand`, so there is nothing
to guess — brute force costs 2²⁵⁶ operations, and no counter changes that
number. What a counter *would* buy is a denial of service: an unauthenticated
caller who can trip a per-IP or per-token limit can lock the real operator out
of a dashboard at the moment they most need it, which is during an incident.
The one cost of a login attempt here is a single indexed SELECT on a hash.

If a deployment wants a limiter anyway — because it is exposed to the open
internet, or because a policy demands one — the right place for it is the
reverse proxy already terminating TLS, where it can be tuned and disabled
without a redeploy.

## The first-run setup token

Installing RestoreLab from a browser means one endpoint accepts a Proxmox
administrator's password. That is worth being precise about.

`restorelab serve` with no configuration starts in setup mode: it exposes
`/api/v1/health`, the dashboard's files, and two setup routes. Every other
route answers 503 — there is no database and no provider to answer with, and
saying so is better than asking for a token that could not exist yet.

The setup routes are guarded four ways, and the fourth is the strongest:

1. **A one-time token, printed on the console.** It is generated from
   `crypto/rand` at startup, held in the process — there is no database to
   keep it in — and compared in constant time. The person installing is the
   one sitting at that console; nobody else is.

2. **Spent by the first attempt to provision, whatever its outcome.** A token
   still live after a wrong password would be a secret printed on a console
   and valid until the process ends, which is not what one-time means. A
   failed attempt therefore costs a restart to get a new token, and that is
   the intended trade.

   It is spent at the last moment before the cluster is touched, and
   atomically, so two requests arriving together cannot both provision. A
   request the endpoint refuses before that point - malformed JSON, no storage
   named - does not spend it. The caller has already proved it holds the
   token, and a typo costing a restart of the whole server buys nothing.

3. **Refused in clear off loopback.** The same rule `POST /session` applies,
   through the same function: without TLS, and to anything but this machine,
   the request is refused naming TLS before the body is read. An
   administrator password does not travel in clear to another host.

4. **Gone once a cluster is connected.** The routes are not mounted at all on
   a configured server — not 403, absent. This is an absence rather than an
   authorisation check, which is a stronger thing to be: there is no code path
   to get wrong.

The administrator password is used in memory to create the service account
and is never stored, never logged, and never echoed back — refusals are
scrubbed on their way out, and a test asserts the password does not appear in
the response.

The structural guarantee behind that is the package boundary. `internal/api`
imports neither `internal/crypto` nor `internal/providers`; provisioning
happens on the other side of an interface the CLI implements, so a handler
cannot reach the master key or a sealed secret even by accident. A test reads
the package's own import statements and fails if either appears.

The token the wizard leaves you with is an ordinary API token named
`dashboard`, with the read, operate and manage scopes — the person who just
installed RestoreLab. It is returned exactly once, to the page that asked, and
exchanged immediately for a session cookie. Revoke it like any other:
`restorelab token revoke dashboard`.

## Destructive-operation guardrails

RestoreLab only ever destroys what it created. Concretely:

1. Every temporary workload is stamped at creation with
   `restorelab_managed=true`, `restorelab_run_id`, `restorelab_source_id`,
   `restorelab_created_at`, and the `restorelab` tag.
2. `Delete` re-reads the workload and returns `resource is not managed by
   restorelab` unless that metadata is present. There is no override flag.
3. Temporary IDs come from a reserved range (`9000–9999` by default) and are
   allocated from the cluster's free-ID endpoint; a restore never targets an
   existing workload and never sends Proxmox's `force` parameter.
4. Cleanup runs on a **detached context**: cancelling a run, or a timeout, still
   destroys the temporary workload. A cleanup that fails is reported as
   `CLEANUP_FAILED` with the exact node and VMID, because a silent orphan is the
   worst possible outcome.
5. **An interrupted run is never replayed.** A run whose worker died is marked
   `FAILED`, its temporary workload is destroyed if it can be reached, and it
   is never claimed again — the SQL of the claim itself makes a claimed run
   unclaimable, so this holds across processes and machines, not only within
   one. A queue that "helpfully" retried would restore a second time and
   allocate a second temporary id, most likely orphaning the first. Deciding
   to run the drill again is a human's call.

A cancellation stops the drill at its next observable point and tears down the
temporary workload. It does **not** abort work already running on the
hypervisor: a Proxmox restore task that has started runs to completion, and
RestoreLab deletes the result afterwards. Nothing is left behind either way,
but the cluster stays busy until that task finishes.

## Transport security

- TLS certificate verification is on by default. `insecure: true` exists for
  homelabs with self-signed Proxmox certificates and is a per-provider,
  explicitly opted-in setting.
- PBS certificate **fingerprint pinning** is supported and is the correct choice
  for a self-signed PBS: it verifies the exact certificate instead of trusting
  the system roots.
- A custom CA can be supplied per provider with `ca_cert_path`.

## Deployment guidance

- Run RestoreLab on a host that is **not** your Proxmox node, with network
  access to the API and to the isolated recovery bridge.
- Give the process its own unprivileged user; the master key file and the
  configuration should be readable by that user only.
- In containers, inject `RESTORELAB_MASTER_KEY` as a secret (not an environment
  variable baked into an image, not a build argument).
- Restrict outbound access from the RestoreLab host: it needs your Proxmox API,
  your PBS API, the isolated bridge, and your notification endpoints. Nothing
  else.

## What RestoreLab does not protect against

Stated plainly, because a security document that only lists strengths is
marketing:

- **A compromised RestoreLab host.** An attacker with the master key and the
  configuration has your provider tokens. The scoped Proxmox role limits the
  blast radius (see [proxmox-permissions.md](/guides/proxmox-permissions/)) but
  does not eliminate it.
- **A leaked `operate` token.** It cannot read your provider secrets and it
  cannot touch a production workload, but it can queue drills without limit.
  The worker's concurrency cap and the capacity check keep the cluster from
  being saturated all at once; nothing keeps a flooded queue from keeping it
  busy indefinitely, and there is no rate limit on triggering. Treat an
  operate token as a cluster credential, hand it out accordingly, and revoke
  it with `restorelab token revoke <name>` the moment it is in doubt.
- **A malicious restored guest.** You are booting an untrusted disk image. The
  isolated bridge contains it at the network layer; it is not a hypervisor
  escape mitigation. Do not run drills for workloads you do not trust on a node
  that hosts production.
- **Backup integrity.** RestoreLab proves a backup *recovers*. It does not prove
  it is free of a compromise that predates it: a drill of a backdoored server
  will pass every check.
- **Data confidentiality inside the drill.** A restored production database
  contains production data. The isolated network is the boundary; if someone can
  reach that bridge, they can reach the data.
