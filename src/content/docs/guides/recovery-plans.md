A recovery plan is a YAML file describing **what to restore, where to restore
it, and what must be true afterwards** for the recovery to count as proven.

```bash
restorelab recovery run examples/plans/postgres-prod.yaml
```

Everything except `name` and `workload` has a safe default. Unknown fields are
rejected, so a typo fails the plan instead of silently changing its meaning.

A plan can also be **stored** in RestoreLab's database, which is what lets the
API trigger it by name and what the scheduler will reference. Storing one is
not a condition for running it. See [Stored plans](#stored-plans) below.

### `schedule` and `schedule_timezone`

A plan carrying a `schedule` is drilled on its own, at the stated time, by the
scheduler `restorelab serve` runs. Standard five-field crontab syntax, plus the
`@weekly` family of shorthands.

The expression is read in the server's local timezone unless
`schedule_timezone` names another one. A slot that comes due while nothing was
running is **skipped rather than caught up**: a drill that starts in the
middle of a working day because a server rebooted is an incident, not a test.

A plan with no `schedule` is never scheduled, which is the case for most plans:
ad-hoc drills, one-off verifications, and plans you trigger from the dashboard.

Full details, including the day-of-month/day-of-week caveat and how to read
what the scheduler did, in [scheduling.md](/guides/scheduling/).

### `backup.max_age`

The most underrated field in the file. A drill that restores a three-week-old
backup and passes every check is not good news. Set `max_age` slightly above
your backup interval (`26h` for a nightly job) and a stale backup becomes a
loud, immediate failure instead of a detail buried in a report.

### `restore.network`

Names a network profile from the configuration. `isolated` is the default and
must stay so: see [network-isolation.md](/guides/network-isolation/) for why booting a
restored production clone on a production network is an incident, not a test.

### `startup.wait_for_ip` and `startup.wait_for_agent`

Both default to what the checks actually need, so most plans never set them:

| Plan contains | Waits for an address | Waits for the agent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| network checks (`tcp`, `http`, `ping`, `dns`) | yes | no |
| only in-guest checks (`command`) | **no** | yes |
| both | yes | yes |
| no checks at all | yes | no |

That default is what makes an in-guest drill work with no DHCP on the isolated
bridge: there is no address to wait for, so the run waits for the guest agent
instead. An explicit value in the plan always wins over the default.

### `startup.skip`

Restore-only drill: the backup is restored and the workload created, but never
booted. Useful for workloads you cannot safely start even in isolation, and as
a first onboarding step. Checks are not allowed in a plan that skips startup.

### `cleanup`

`always: true` is the default and should stay that way. `keep_on_failure: true`
preserves the temporary workload after a failed run so you can open its console.
Remember to destroy it afterwards (`restorelab cleanup <vmid>`), because
RestoreLab will not do it for you on the next run.

### `rto_target`

The recovery time objective the run is graded against. RTO is measured from the
start of the run to the end of the checks; cleanup and report generation are
excluded, because they are RestoreLab's housekeeping and not part of the
recovery a business would experience. Exceeding the target does not fail the
run, it downgrades it to `DEGRADED`.

## Checks

Every check shares these fields:

| Field | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | required | Check type (below) |
| `name` | derived | Name shown in reports (`TCP 22`) |
| `timeout` | `30s` | Per-attempt deadline |
| `retries` | `0` | Extra attempts after the first |
| `retry_interval` | `5s` | Wait between attempts |
| `critical` | `true` | A failure fails the run; `false` downgrades it to `DEGRADED` |
| `proves` | deduced | What this check establishes when it passes: `none`, `boot`, `service`, `data` |

A freshly booted service is rarely ready on the first attempt. `retries: 10`
with `retry_interval: 6s` is a better answer than a single long timeout,
because the check passes as soon as the service is up, which is also what makes
the measured RTO honest.

String parameters support templates against the target:
`{{ .ip }}`, `{{ .id }}`, `{{ .node }}`, `{{ .name }}`. An unknown variable is
an error, never a silently empty string.

### `proves`

A verdict says how the drill went. It does not say what the drill
*established*, and those are two different sentences: a plan whose only check
prints the guest's hostname can end `SUCCESS`, and all it proved is that the
kernel came up and can still fork a process. `proves` is what a check says
about the second one.

| Level | What it establishes |
| --- | --- |
| `none` | nothing that counts as evidence, even when it passes |
| `boot` | the OS started and executes code |
| `service` | a service started, with its real configuration and its real data |
| `data` | the data is there and coherent |

The scale is ordered by **what is proven, not by what it costs to arrange**. A
passing `tcp` check on 5432 proves that something is listening on that port,
which is worth less than a query against the data even though it is the one
that needs a route into the recovery network. It enters at `service` and stays
there.

Almost no plan needs to write the field. Left out, the level is deduced, and
the deduction is built to be wrong only in the safe direction. It understates,
never the reverse:

- a `command` whose command line is a bare liveness probe (`hostname`,
  `uname`, `whoami`, `true`, `echo`, `ver`, with or without arguments, with or
  without a directory in front of it) proves `boot`;
- a command line that chains or pipes (`&&`, `||`, `;`, `|`) is no longer
  described by its first program, so it is not read as a liveness probe;
- a `ping` proves `boot` for the same reason: ICMP is answered by the kernel's
  network stack, not by anything anybody deployed. A guest that answers a ping
  has booted and configured its network, and every service on it may still be
  dead;
- everything else proves `service`: every other command, and every `tcp`,
  `http` and `dns` check.

**`data` is only ever claimed by a declaration.** RestoreLab cannot tell from
outside that `psql -tAc 'select count(*) from orders'` reads a row rather than
pokes a socket, and guessing that it does is exactly how a dashboard ends up
claiming more than the drill established.

```yaml
- type: command
  name: orders present
  run: psql -tAc 'select count(*) from orders'
  proves: data
```

A declaration wins in both directions. `proves: none` on a smoke test is
believed too, and so is `proves: boot` on a `systemctl is-system-running`
check that RestoreLab would otherwise have read as a service check.

Values are case-insensitive. An unknown one fails validation when the plan is
written (`plan validate`, `plan apply`, or loading the file for a run), never
silently at three in the morning.

### `ping`

Is the guest answering ICMP at all?

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | the target IP | Host to ping |
| `count` | `3` | Echo requests to send |
| `interval` | `500ms` | Delay between requests |
| `privileged` | `false` | Raw ICMP instead of unprivileged UDP ping |

Reports `packets_sent`, `packets_recv`, `avg_rtt_ms`, `packet_loss`. ICMP is
often filtered: a failing ping check with a passing TCP check usually means a
firewall, not a broken recovery. If the OS refuses the socket, the check reports
an *error* (not a failure) and points you at `privileged`.

### `tcp`

The workhorse: is the port actually open?

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | the target IP | Host to connect to |
| `port` | required | TCP port |
| `expect_banner` |  | Substring the server must send on connect |

```yaml
- type: tcp
  name: PostgreSQL
  port: 5432
  retries: 5
  retry_interval: 5s
```

### `http` / `https`

Does the application answer, and answer correctly?

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `url` | required | Target URL, template-expanded |
| `method` | `GET` | HTTP method |
| `expected_status` | `200` | Expected status code |
| `expected_statuses` |  | List of acceptable codes; wins over `expected_status` |
| `headers` |  | Request headers (values template-expanded) |
| `body` |  | Request body |
| `body_contains` |  | Substring the response must contain |
| `body_matches` |  | Regular expression the response must match |
| `json_path` |  | Dotted path into the JSON response (`status.database`, `items.0.name`) |
| `json_equals` |  | Value that path must equal |
| `insecure_tls` | `false` | Skip certificate verification |
| `follow_redirects` | `true` | Follow 3xx |
| `max_body_bytes` | `1 MiB` | Response bytes read before truncating |

```yaml
- type: http
  name: health endpoint
  url: http://{{ .ip }}:8080/health
  expected_status: 200
  json_path: status
  json_equals: ok
  retries: 10
  retry_interval: 6s
```

Reports `status_code`, `latency_ms`, `body_size` and a truncated `body_snippet`.

### `command`

Runs a command **inside** the restored guest through the hypervisor's guest
agent. It travels over the Proxmox API, so it needs no network path into the
recovery network at all: no route, no DHCP on the isolated bridge, no runner
beside it. It also sees things a network probe never could: a systemd unit's
real state, a file's contents, a local socket, a database query over a Unix
socket.

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `run` |  | Command line, executed through a shell in the guest |
| `argv` |  | List of strings, executed directly with no shell |
| `shell` | auto-detected | Interpreter for `run`: a path, or `sh`, `bash`, `cmd`, `powershell` |
| `expect` |  | Trimmed stdout must equal this exactly |
| `stdout_contains` |  | Substring stdout must contain |
| `stdout_matches` |  | Regular expression stdout must match |
| `expect_exit_code` | `0` | Required exit code |
| `input` |  | Written to the command's standard input |
| `max_output_bytes` | `65536` | Cap on captured output |

Exactly one of `run` and `argv` is required. Assertions are evaluated in
order: exit code, `expect`, `stdout_contains`, `stdout_matches`.

Leave `shell` out and the check asks the guest agent what operating system it
is running (`agent/get-osinfo`, the same privilege IP discovery already uses)
and picks `cmd` on Windows, `/bin/sh` everywhere else. Set it explicitly when
you want something specific (`powershell`, `bash`, an interpreter path) or
when the guest is one the agent does not describe. If detection fails and the
command then cannot run at all, the check says so, naming the shell it fell
back to.

```yaml
- type: command
  name: PostgreSQL
  run: systemctl is-active postgresql
  expect: active
  retries: 10
  retry_interval: 6s

- type: command
  name: production database queryable
  run: psql -U postgres -d production -tAc 'select 1'
  expect: "1"
```

Requires `qemu-guest-agent` installed and running in the guest, and the agent
enabled on the VM (*VM → Options → QEMU Guest Agent*), which is also what
gives you filesystem-consistent backups, so it is worth having anyway.

A command that runs and gives the wrong answer is a **failure**. A guest with
no agent, or an API that refuses the call, is an **error**: the report says
"I could not ask", never "your service is broken". See
[deployment.md](/guides/deployment/) for when to prefer in-guest over network checks.

Reports `exit_code`, `stdout`, `stderr`, `truncated` and the resolved `argv`.

### `dns`

Does the restored resolver answer, or does a name resolve from inside the
recovery network?

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | required | Name to resolve |
| `server` | the target IP | DNS server to query |
| `port` | `53` | Server port |
| `type` | `A` | `A`, `AAAA`, `CNAME`, `MX`, `TXT` |
| `expect` |  | Expected answers; passes when **any** answer matches |

## Grading

| Verdict | When |
| --- | --- |
| `SUCCESS` | Every critical check passed and the RTO target was met |
| `DEGRADED` | Recovered, but a non-critical check failed or the RTO target was exceeded |
| `FAILED` | A workflow step failed, or a critical check failed |
| `INCONCLUSIVE` | The workload restored and booted, but a critical check could not be evaluated at all, so the drill reached no verdict. It carries **no** result and does not count against the workload's confidence score |
| `CLEANUP_FAILED` | The drill finished but the temporary workload could not be destroyed: needs manual attention, with the node and VMID named in the error |

`INCONCLUSIVE` exists because "I could not tell" is not the same news as "your
backup is broken", and a tool that confuses the two stops being worth
believing. The usual cause is a `tcp:`, `http:`, `dns:` or `ping` check
dialling a guest that the machine running RestoreLab has no route to, which
is the normal state of affairs, since the recovery bridge is isolated on
purpose. A check that failed for that reason says nothing about the backup,
so the run says nothing either.

### What the run proved

The verdict and the proof level answer different questions, so a report prints
both:

```text
Result   SUCCESS
Proved   SERVICE  (the service was verified, the data was not)
```

A run's level is the **maximum over the checks that actually passed**. A check
that failed, that could not run, or that never ran establishes nothing, and
contributes nothing here in either direction: the exact counterpart of the
`INCONCLUSIVE` rule above. A PostgreSQL that boots but whose `systemctl
is-active` check fails stays at `BOOT` *and* takes the failure penalty: two
different true statements about the same drill.

`BOOT` comes from the guest agent answering (it runs inside the guest) or
from an in-guest check passing. Never from power state: a hypervisor
reporting a running process cannot tell a booted OS from a guest sitting at
its boot loader. A `startup.skip` drill therefore proves `NONE`, however well
the restore itself went.

The level is also a **ceiling on the workload's confidence score**: `NONE`
caps it at 40, `BOOT` at 60, `SERVICE` at 85, `DATA` not at all. A workload
drilled daily, on time, from a fresh backup, whose only check prints its
hostname has earned every point the penalties leave it and still proven only
that the kernel boots. See
[architecture.md](/reference/architecture/#the-proof-level) for the ceiling and why it
is a ceiling rather than another penalty.

`plan validate` says what a plan would prove before anyone spends five minutes
drilling with it:

```
$ restorelab plan validate examples/plans/postgres-prod.yaml
✓ examples/plans/postgres-prod.yaml: postgres-prod (proves SERVICE, the service would be verified, the data would not)
```

### Choosing checks for an isolated drill

A guest booted on a network that goes nowhere does not behave like one on your
production network, and that changes what a good check looks like.

`systemctl is-system-running` is the tempting one, and it is usually the wrong
one: on an isolated bridge it can stay `starting` indefinitely, because units
like `cloud-init` or `systemd-networkd-wait-online` are waiting for a network
that will never answer. The recovery is fine; the check is asking the wrong
question. Verified on a Debian cloud image, which never left `starting`.

Check the service you actually care about instead:

```yaml
- type: command
  name: SSH
  run: systemctl is-active ssh
  expect: active

- type: command
  name: PostgreSQL accepting connections
  run: pg_isready -h /var/run/postgresql
```

The same applies to anything that reaches outward: a health endpoint that
calls a payment API or a message broker will fail in isolation for reasons
that have nothing to do with your backup. Test what the workload *is*, not
what it can reach.

The same reasoning applies from the other direction, and it decides which
*kind* of check to write. `command` checks run inside the guest, through the
hypervisor's guest agent (the same path RestoreLab already used to restore
and boot the workload), so they work no matter where RestoreLab is installed.
`tcp`, `http`, `dns` and `ping` checks dial the guest from wherever RestoreLab
runs, and the recovery bridge is built so that nothing can do that. They are
worth using when you have deliberately arranged a route into the recovery
network (RestoreLab on the node itself, or a routed isolated VLAN), because
they test something an in-guest check cannot see: that the guest reconfigured
its own network and a service is reachable as a service. Everywhere else they
cannot run, and a drill that cannot run its critical checks ends
`INCONCLUSIVE`.

This is also why an ad-hoc drill with no `--check` runs `cmd:hostname`: it is
a small claim, but it is one that holds on every installation. It is also
literally a small claim: that drill proves `BOOT` and the report says so,
rather than letting a green verdict imply the service came back.

## Stored plans

A plan file runs directly, and always will:

```bash
restorelab recovery run examples/plans/postgres-prod.yaml
```

That path needs no database at all. It is deliberate: a drill must never
depend on the journal (a locked database or a full disk cannot be allowed to
stop a recovery test), and a plan under git, applied by a CI job, is a
perfectly sound way to work.

Storing a plan is how it becomes something *other machines* can name:

```bash
restorelab plan apply examples/plans/postgres-prod.yaml   # created postgres-prod
restorelab plan apply examples/plans/postgres-prod.yaml   # updated postgres-prod to v2
restorelab plan list
restorelab plan show postgres-prod > postgres-prod.yaml
restorelab plan delete postgres-prod
restorelab recovery run --plan postgres-prod
```

`plan apply` is an upsert **by name**: the name in the document decides
whether a plan is created or replaced, and each replacement increments the
plan's version. Several files in one call, because a directory of plans under
git is the normal case.

`plan validate` is the only one of these that works without a database. It
parses and validates and stores nothing, which is exactly what a CI wants to
run before it applies anything, on a machine that has no RestoreLab
configuration.

`recovery run` takes **either** a file **or** `--plan <name>`, never both. A
file argument and a stored name are two different plans, and picking one
silently is how the wrong drill ends up running.

### What is stored, and what a run remembers

The document is stored **verbatim**: comments, key order, the lot. `plan show`
gives back what was written, not a re-serialised approximation of it.

Each run keeps its own **snapshot** of the plan it actually executed, defaults
applied, in the `runs` table. The two are different on purpose:

| | Answers |
| --- | --- |
| `plans.plan_yaml` | what somebody wrote, and what will run next time |
| `runs.plan_snapshot` | what actually ran, on that day |

That is why editing a plan never rewrites history, and why deleting one does
not either. A run keeps its plan's name and its snapshot; only the link goes.
A drill already in flight is untouched, because the worker executes the
snapshot taken when the run was queued, never the catalogue row.

### Node, storage and pool are not in the plan

A plan describes a **drill**, not a deployment. Where the temporary workload
lands (node, storage, resource pool) comes from the configuration of
whoever executes it, not from the plan. The fields exist in `restore:` as
overrides for the case where one plan genuinely must pin its placement, but
leaving them out is the normal thing to do: it is what lets the same plan run
from a laptop, from `serve`, and from the scheduler without being three
different files.

## Writing a good plan

1. **Start with `tcp` on SSH, or a `command` check.** Either proves the guest
   booted and started a service. Prefer `command` when you have no route into
   the recovery network, which is the common case. Add application checks
   after that works.
2. **Check the thing that matters, not the thing that is easy.** "Port 5432 is
   open" is weaker than "the health endpoint reports the database is
   reachable". The whole point of RestoreLab is the difference between the two.
3. **Mark cosmetic checks `critical: false`** so a broken favicon does not turn
   a genuine successful recovery into a red alert.
4. **Set `rto_target` to your actual contractual objective**, not to what you
   currently achieve. A `DEGRADED` verdict on a real target is information; a
   green run against a target you invented is not.
5. **Set `max_age`.** A plan without it will happily prove that a very old
   backup restores beautifully.
6. **Say `proves: data` on the check that reads the data.** It is the one
   level RestoreLab never deduces on its own, and the only one that lets a
   workload's confidence score go above 85. An empty database that boots
   perfectly passes every other kind of check.
